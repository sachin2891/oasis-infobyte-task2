                <h2>Nikola Tesla</h2>
            </b>

            <h3> 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="things">
            <ul>
                <li>In perhaps the best foreshadowing in history, Tesla was born around midnight during a fierce
                    lightning storm in Serbia. The midwife thought it was a bad omen and that he would be a child of
                    darkness, but Tesla’s mother prophetically said, “No, he will be a child of light.”

                </li>
                <li>Playing into his stereotype of a mad scientist, Tesla suffered from many characteristics that today
                    would likely be classified as obsessive-compulsive disorder. He was obsessed with the number three
                    and detested jewelry, round objects, and touching hair.

                    He was particularly wary of pearls and wouldn’t talk to women wearing them; he even sent his
                    secretary home when she wore pearl jewelry. He was also an insomniac and claimed he only needed two
                    hours of sleep at night, though he often took afternoon naps.</li>
                <li>After a near-fatal case of cholera as a teenager, Tesla became obsessive about germs and cleaning
                    everything. He has an extensive and rigid personal hygiene routine, used 18 napkins to wipe his
                    dining room every night, and wore white gloves to every dinner.

                </li>
                <li>Believe it or not, in 1901, Tesla actually had the idea for a wireless way to gather information,
                    code it in his lab, change the frequency, and broadcast it to a hand-held device—nearly exactly how
                    our smartphones work today. Like many of Tesla’s great ideas, it was never created or tested.</li>
                <li>Tesla had the power to memorize entire books and pictures with great detail, which is assumed to be
                    part of the cause of his terrible nightmares as a child. He also had visions of numerous inventions
                    filed away in his brain, many of which never made it onto paper. One of Tesla’s most unique
                    attributes was the ability to visualize in 3D, allowing him to see all sides of an invention before
                    it was created.</li>


                <p>The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.
                    The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade
                    than in all the previous centuries of its existence.
                    Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no
                    more.</p>
